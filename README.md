touchable slider with dots and arrows
This is my touchable slider.
It is possible to swipe the slides and click on arrows to switch the next slide and aslo click on dots.
Also I tried to do it adaptiv to different devices screens mobile and desctop.
Also you can see in the right coner the counter of slides. It shows current slide and total number of slides.
